<h3>Kacchi Mutton Biryani is a delicious rice dish where tender goat or lamb meat pieces are marinated with lots of fried onions,
     whole spices, fresh herbs and yoghurt. This marinated meat sits on the bottom of the pot topped with half-cooked rice which is drizzled with saffron-infused water
      and more fried onions and fresh mint leaves.</h3>

</ul>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<ol>
    <strong>Prepare the crispy fried onions</strong>
    <li>Heat enough oil in a wide shallow pan or kadai.</li>
    <li>Separate the strands of the sliced onions with your hands.</li>
    <li>Test the oil by dropping one small onion strand, if it sizzles up then you can continue.</li>
    <li>Keep the flame low to medium all time, stir in between to fry evenly and fry till you see the onions changing shades (4 mins).</li>
    <li>Remove the onions with a slotted spoon on time before they get burnt. The onions will continue to cook even when you take them out, so remove them when you see the golden light brown shade.</li>
    <li>Spread the fried onions on a paper towel to drain the excess oil (It will become crispy as it cools).</li>
    <li>Let it cool completely before storing it in an airtight box and in the freezer.</li>
</ol>

<ol> <strong>Marinate the Mutton</strong>
    <li>Boil the water in a deep large pot with salt, green chillies, cardamoms and cloves.</li>
    <li>Stir in the drained rice and bring to boil on a high flame.</li>
    <li>Reduce to medium flame and boil for just about 90 seconds to 2 minutes (30% to 50% cooked) and switch off.</li>
    <li>Drain the rice in a colander immediately.</li>
    <li>Reserve ¼ cup of water for later.</li>
</ol>

<ol> <strong>Prepare the Kacchi Mutton Biryani Pot</strong>
    <li>Spread the marinated mutton in a single layer on the bottom of the biryani pot (oven friendly).</li>
    <li>Spread the drained rice evenly and pour the reserved water all around (in case you feel the rice is almost cooked because you forgot to drain on time, then skip adding the reserved water).</li>
    <li>Add the fried onions, mint leaves and saffron water (you may squeeze some lemon juice or rose water and a few dollops of ghee for extra flavour)</li>
    <li>Cover and seal the pot with foil and then with the lid.</li>
</ol>

<ol><strong>Bake or Dum cook</strong>
    <li>If making in the oven, then preheat the oven from 165°C to 170°C with the rack on level 2.</li>
    <li>If making on a stovetop, place a heat diffuser (or any flat pan) on low flame and keep the biryani pot over the diffuser. This will ensure even heat distribution and prevent the burning of food. Dum-cook for 45 mins to 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Open and remove the foil and let it cool for 5 minutes before you stir the rice (You may dig and check if the meat is done. If you feel it needs more cooking, then put it back in the oven. The residue heat of the oven will be enough to get it done)</li>
    <li>Serve Hot</li>
