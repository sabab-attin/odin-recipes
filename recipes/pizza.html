<h3><strong>Pizza always makes a bad day feel better, and there’s nothing nicer than a perfect slice of margherita pizza. </strong></h3>

<p><em>Pizza Margherita,</em> as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from Naples.</p>

<p>When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. That is all.</p>

<ul><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>
    <li>Store Bought Pizza Dough</li>
    <li>San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Fresh Mozzarella Balls</li>
    <li>Fresh Basil</li>
    <li>Salt(to taste)</li>
</ul>


<ol>
    <strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you’re using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. Prepare dough through step 5.</li>
    <li>Place a medium mixing bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into the bowl, juices and all. Crush the tomatoes by hand. Spread about ¾ cup of the tomato sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges.</li>
    <li>If your mozzarella is packed in water, drain off the water and gently pat the mozzarella dry on a clean tea towel or paper towels. If you’re working with large mozzarella balls, tear them into smaller 1-inch balls. Distribute the mozzarella over the pizza, concentrating it a bit more in the center of the pizza, as it will melt toward the edges.</li>
    <li>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is just turning golden, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</li>
    <li>Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a light back-and-forth drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkling of salt, and red pepper flakes, if you wish. Slice and enjoy. Leftover pizza will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
</ol>
